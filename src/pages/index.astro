    <p>
      I started as a freelance designer and developer, but at some point decided
      to focus on frontend development. This has given me a special perspective
      on how to approach a project and visually implement it effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm comfortable working with different teams, including Design, Content,
      and Engineering, to find the right solutions and deliver high-quality
      products.
    </p>

    <p>
      This helps to avoid unrealistic requirements and surprises, resulting in
      less frustration and better products. A solid design system is key to a
      smooth workflow, strong brand, and maintainable code.
