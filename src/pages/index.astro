		<p>I started as a freelance designer and developer, but in recent years I've focused on frontend development. This has given me a special perspective on how to approach a project and visually implement it effectively.</p>

		<p>I'm comfortable working with different teams, including Design, Content, and Engineering, to find the right solutions and deliver high-quality products.</p>

		<p>This helps to avoid unrealistic requirements and surprises, resulting in less frustration and better products. A solid design system is key to a smooth workflow, strong brand, and maintainable code.</p>
