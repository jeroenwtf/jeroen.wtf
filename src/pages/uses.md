## Domains and hosting

To buy domains I like the weirdos of [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) and for hosting I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/).


## Hardware

Aside from tons of RPIs and some homelabs, my daily driver is a [Framework Laptop 16](https://frame.work/laptop-16). I'm pretty happy about it and the idea of being able to repair and upgrade it myself is great.

My keyboard is a [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) with a custom keymap on [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/). I used mechanical keyboards for a decade and boy do I like to build and use them.

I ditched the common mouse and got a [ELECOM HUGE trackball](https://www.elecom.co.jp/global/product/M-HT1DRBK/) and remapped half of the buttons. Now I can scroll with ludicrous speed.

To test and play with NFC and other nice things I use a [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/).

I play video games with a [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/). I swapped the original 64 GB SSD for a 512 GB one and the shell for a semi-transparent one and it looks dope. I honestly think is the best piece of gaming hardware I ever bought.

Lastly, to stay alive I as type 1 diabetic I use [Freestyle Libre 2+](https://www.freestyle.abbott/us-en/products/freestyle-libre-2.html) CGM sensors and a pixel display I build connected to my [Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info/) instance.


## Software

I do most of my work in the terminal. You can check [my dotfiles](https://github.com/jeroenwtf/dotfiles) for my setup.

- **OS:** [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/).
- **Terminal:** [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) with [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) and [starship](https://starship.rs/).
- **Code editor:** [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
- **Browser:** [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).
- **Git:** [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), but I also like to use the command line.
- For note-taking and writing and organise thoughts I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- [posting](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting) for testing and working with APIs.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) for task management. Love it.
- Other nice things I use daily: [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza), [z](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z), [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker), [restic](https://restic.net/), [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

For storing my git repos I use mostly [GitHub](https://github.com/) and to automate workflows I use a self-hosted [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

Remember to pay open source maintainers for their work. It's the right thing to do.


## Design

- I was a heavy [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) user long time ago. Nowadays I either use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or just code directly.


## Security

Yeah, I'm not telling you.
