New version of my little corner of the interwebs. It's funny because I was using [Astro](https://astro.build/) but switched to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and now went back to Astro. Makes everything less bloated and easy to manage.

I'm still working in the integration between this page and some of my personal notes. I want to have them published. It will be a way to push me to work on them and keeping them up to date and polished. Mostly things about programming, but who knows.

So, this section also works with collections of markdown files. As usual, you can find it [in my repo](https://github.com/jeroenwtf/jeroen.wtf).
