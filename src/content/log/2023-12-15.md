I'm getting ready to move back to the center of Barcelona, to the same studio I was living back in 2020.

Codewise I've been learning Ruby on Rails. Reminds me of the time I was doing PHP, kind of missed it. Aside from that, in the last week I've been feeling more curiosity about AI technologies. Maybe I will get into it more seriously soon.
